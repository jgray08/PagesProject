This is a project I completed for CS50x 2023. It is a program that takes in an input image, applies a filter based on user input, and outputs the resulting image. This is the filtering portion of code, written by me. The rest of the code for usage of this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jgray08/CS50/tree/main/filter-less" target="_blank" class="link">GitHub</a>. This code demonstrates an understanding of the general C syntax, the usage and declaration of structs, and the usage of external header files.

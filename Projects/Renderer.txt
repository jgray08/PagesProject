This is my custom renderer written in C#. It uses a familiar X, Y coordinate system to display different colored pixels in the console by changing the foreground color. This was the first project I truly began experimenting with C# in. This project eventually spiraled into my game, MultiplayerSnake. It went through *many* iterations to get where it is now. I am very proud of what it became. You can view the full integration with my midterm project on my <a href="https://github.com/jgray08/MultiplayerSnake" target="_blank" class="link">GitHub</a>.

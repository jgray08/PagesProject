This is my miderm project for PROG-101 taken at Columbia College. It is a Snake game played by 2 players, that uses a custom renderer to display the gamestate via external console. This is only the game.cs file, it handles most of the games logic. You can view the rest of the source code on <a href="https://github.com/jgray08/MultiplayerSnake" target="_blank" class="link">GitHub</a>. It is my first real project done in C#. I am proud of the end result, but looking back, it could benefit greatly from some refactoring.
